# mem-dump

This is a zig port of the [python memory dumper](https://github.com/lowbyteproductions/memory-dumper) code written in ["Getting up in another processes memory" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ihChIaN8d0) I made on the Low Byte Productions YouTube channel.

It's a small project meant for getting to grips with zig, and as such is probably doing a bunch of stuff wrong/weird.
